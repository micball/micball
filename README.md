- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name's Michael Ballif.
- 
- ðŸ‘€ I'm a lifelong learner, and I'm very excited to be learning how to program.  I come from a background in the arts, ad although a lot of this is relatively new to me, I'm excited to be diving in and starting a career as a programmer.
- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript thorugh Free Code Camp, and I'm diving into a couple of personal projects using ReactNative to build a suite of apps for the entertainment industry.

- ðŸ“« If you're curious about anything I'm working on, or are interested in collaborating on anything, feel free to reach out to me at mballifcodes@gmail.com.
