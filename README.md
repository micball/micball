I'm a lifelong learner, a self taught developer, and a voice over artist.
 
I'm currently working on my Google Career Certificate in Cybersecurity, and teaching myself full-stack development through The Odin Project, Harvard's CS50 courses, and a variety of other sources.

If you're curious about anything I'm working on, or are interested in collaborating with me, feel free to reach out to me at mballifcodes@gmail.com.
