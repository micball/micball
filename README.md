I'm a lifelong learner, a self taught developer, and a voice over artist.
 
I'm currently I'm living primarily in front-end development, but I'm very interested in continuing to expand my skills toward full-stack development.

If you're curious about anything I'm working on, or are interested in collaborating with me, feel free to reach out to me at mballifcodes@gmail.com.
