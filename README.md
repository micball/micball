- 👋 Hi, I’m @micball
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about programming.  I come from a background in the arts, so this is all pretty new to me, and I'm excited to be diving in!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, and I'm diving into a project right now to get my first taste of React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything.  I'm relatively new to programming, so projects that don't have a really quick timeline are ideal.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
