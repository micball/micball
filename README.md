- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name's Michael Ballif.

- ðŸ‘€ I'm a lifelong learner, and I'm very excited to be continuing to learn how to be a better programmer.  I'm a self taught developer with a background in the arts, and although a lot of this is a pretty big step away from putting on a play, I'm excited to be learning and contributing as a web developer.
 
- ðŸŒ± Currently I'm living primarily in front-end development, but I'm very interested in continuing to expand my skills toward full-stack development.

- ðŸ“« If you're curious about anything I'm working on, or are interested in collaborating with me, feel free to reach out to me at mballifcodes@gmail.com.
