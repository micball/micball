- 👋 Hi, I’m @micball
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about programming.  I come from a background in the arts, so this is all pretty new to me, and I'm excited to be diving in!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, and I'm diving into a couple of projects using ReactNative to build a couple of apps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
