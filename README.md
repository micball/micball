I'm a lifelong learner, a self taught developer with a background in the arts, and although a lot of this is a pretty big step away from putting on a play, I'm excited to be making the jump into software engineering.
 
I'm currently I'm living primarily in front-end development, but I'm very interested in continuing to expand my skills toward full-stack development.

If you're curious about anything I'm working on, or are interested in collaborating with me, feel free to reach out to me at mballifcodes@gmail.com.
